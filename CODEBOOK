Course Project: Getting & Cleaning Data
Using the “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset”

Description:
Using the UCI HAR (Human Activity Recognition) Dataset, will 1) Merge the training and the test sets; 2) Extract only
the mean and standard deviation for each measurement; 3) Substitute descriptive activity names in the data set; 4) Label
the data set with descriptive variable names; 5) Create a tidy data set named avg_dat.txt with the average of each variable
for each activity and each subject. 

Information on the data used, the original source, URL and variables:
    See more details at the following URL:
        http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
    The data itself is located at:
        https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
        
    Per the URL above: "The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
    Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
    wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured
    3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded
    to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was
    selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data."

    Also per the URL: "The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then
    sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which
    has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and
    gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff
    frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency
    domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details."
    
    From the README.TXT in the dataset zip file, more details on the data/variables:
        "For each record it is provided:
        ======================================
        - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
        - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
        - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
        - Its activity label. 
        - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

        The dataset includes the following files:
        =========================================
        - 'README.txt'
        - 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
        - 'features.txt': List of all features.
        - 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
        - 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
        - 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
        - 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
        - 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
        The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
        - 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.
              Its range is from 1 to 30. 
        - 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis
              in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the
              'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
        - 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity
              from the total acceleration. 
        - 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each
              window sample. The units are radians/second. 
        Notes: 
        ======
        - Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
        - Each feature vector is a row on the text file."

Here are the general outline of the Assignment4.R Script and steps to be done on the data by running the script:

- Script Description and requirements (see the R script)
- Use the plyr package and the invoke library(plyr) to make active
- Read x_test data into x_tst from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)
-      table x_tst will have 2947 obs. (rows) of 561 variables, labelled: v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 ... v561 each containing a real number
- Read y_test data into y_tst from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)
-      table y_tst will have 2947 obs. (rows) of 1 variable, labelled: v1 containing a number from 1-6
-      the numbers in y_tst correspond to the activities in the actvlbls table 
- Read subject_test data into subj_tst from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)
-      table subj_tst will have 2947 obs. (rows) of 1 variable, labelled: v1 containing a number from 1-24
-      the numbers in subj_trn correspond to the activities in the actvlbls table 
- Read x_train data into x_trn from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)

- Read y_train data into y_trn from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)
-      table y_trn will have 7352 obs. (rows) of 1 variable, labelled: v1 containing a number from 1-6
- Read subject_train data into subj_trn from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)
-      table subj_trn will have 7352 obs. (rows) of 1 variable, labelled: v1 containing a number from 1-6
-      the numbers in subj_trn correspond to the activities in the actvlbls table 
- Read feature table data into table ftrs from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)
-      the feature table consists of variables v1 and v2
-      v1 = an feature index; v2 = a feature name; these will be used as the new column names
- Read the activity labels data into table actvlbls from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)
-      the actvlbls labels table consists of variables v1 and v2
-      v1 = a activity label index; v2 = an activity name; these will be used as the new activity names
- Combine the training and test data tables: 
-      x_dat will consist of x_tst with x_trn concatenated onto it using rbind
-      y_dat will consist of y_tst with y_trn concatenated onto it using rbind
-      subj_dat will consist of subj_tst with subj_trn concatenated onto it using rbind
-      x_dat will be 10299 observations of 66 variables
-      y_dat will be 10299 observations of 1 variables
-      subj_dat will be 10299 observations of 1 variable
- Pull out only mean and std variables into the tidy data set, label and put into x_dat, renaming columns
- Use descriptive activity names to label the activities in the data set
- average all data (mean and std) columns
- place all tidy data into file avg_dat
