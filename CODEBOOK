Course Project: Getting & Cleaning Data
Using the “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset”

<Briefly describe the code book in a couple of sentences – what the project does>

<Give information on the Data Set to be used – a couple of paragraphs on what the purpose of the data is and how it was created>

<Give information on the original data source, URL and the variables contained within it>

<Give requirements of the details and tranforms to be done on the data by running the R script. >

Here is the general flow of the R script:

- Description
- Requirements fulfilled by the R Script
- Use the plyr package and the invoke library(plyr) to make active
- Read x_test data into x_tst from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)
-      table x_tst will have 2947 obs. (rows) of 561 variables, labelled: v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 ... v561 each containing a real number
- Read y_test data into y_tst from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)
-      table y_tst will have 2947 obs. (rows) of 1 variable, labelled: v1 containing a number from 1-6
-      the numbers in y_tst correspond to the activities in the actvlbls table 
- Read subject_test data into subj_tst from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)
-      table subj_tst will have 2947 obs. (rows) of 1 variable, labelled: v1 containing a number from 1-24
-      the numbers in subj_trn correspond to the activities in the actvlbls table 
- Read x_train data into x_trn from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)
-      table x_trn will have 7352 obs. (rows) of 561 variables, labelled: v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 ... v561 each containing a real number
- Read y_train data into y_trn from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)
-      table y_trn will have 7352 obs. (rows) of 1 variable, labelled: v1 containing a number from 1-6
- Read subject_train data into subj_trn from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)
-      table subj_trn will have 7352 obs. (rows) of 1 variable, labelled: v1 containing a number from 1-6
-      the numbers in subj_trn correspond to the activities in the actvlbls table 
- Read feature table data into table ftrs from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)
-      the feature table consists of variables v1 and v2
-      v1 = an feature index; v2 = a feature name; these will be used as the new column names
- Read the activity labels data into table actvlbls from specified path (optionally use choose.files() to select the file you want)
-      the actvlbls labels table consists of variables v1 and v2
-      v1 = a activity label index; v2 = an activity name; these will be used as the new activity names
- Combine the training and test data tables: 
-      x_dat will consist of x_tst with x_trn concatenated onto it using rbind
-      y_dat will consist of y_tst with y_trn concatenated onto it using rbind
-      subj_dat will consist of subj_tst with subj_trn concatenated onto it using rbind
-      x_dat will be 10299 observations of 66 variables
-      y_dat will be 10299 observations of 1 variables
-      subj_dat will be 10299 observations of 1 variable
- Pull out only mean and std variables into the tidy data set, label and put into x_dat, renaming columns
- Use descriptive activity names to label the activities in the data set
- average all data (mean and std) columns
- place all tidy data into file avg_dat
