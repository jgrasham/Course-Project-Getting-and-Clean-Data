Course Project: Getting & Cleaning Data
Using the “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset”

This is a text document that describes data, variables, tranforms and work that was undertaken in order to take raw source data, massage it as needed, to create in the end of the process, a tidy data set that would be useful for subsequent work, processing or visualization.

Per the course project, the requirements for this project are:
- "The submitted data set is tidy."
- "The Github repo contains the required scripts."
- "GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information."
- "The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable."
- "The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it."

On the UCI HAR Dataset:

The basic requirements of this class project will be fulfilled by :
- creating/submitting the resulting data set that is the output of this project avg_dat.txt
- creating/submitting a README file (this file) that describes the project
- creating/submitting a CODEBOOK that describes the data itself
- creating/submitting an Assignment4.R script that performs the following steps:

Steps to be performed:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
- From the data set in step 4, creates a tidy data set named avg_dat.txt with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The output file is called avg_dat.txt, and has been uploaded to this repository.
