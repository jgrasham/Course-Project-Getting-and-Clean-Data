Course Project: Getting & Cleaning Data
Using the “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset”

This is a text document that describes data, variables, tranforms and work that was undertaken in order to take raw source data, massage it as needed, to create in the end of the process, a tidy data set that would be useful for subsequent work, processing or visualization.

The basic requirements of this class project will be fulfilled by creating/submitting a README file (this file) that describes the prject itself, creating/submitting a CODEBOOK that describes the data itself, and creating/submitting an R script that performs the the following steps:

“Requirements & Details of Transformations through run_analysis.R The script run_analysis.R has the following requirements to perform transformation on UCI HAR Dataset.
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set ,averages_data.txt with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The output file is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded to this repository.”
