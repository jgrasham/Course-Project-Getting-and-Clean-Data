Course Project: Getting & Cleaning Data
Using the “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset”

<Briefly describe the README in a couple of sentences – what the project does>
Example (DO NOT USE, EXAMPLE ONLY):
 “This CodeBook that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the source data to create a tidy dataset as per requirements of course project.”

<Give requirements of the details and tranforms to be done on the data by running the R script. >
Example (DO NOT USE, EXAMPLE ONLY):
“Requirements & Details of Transformations through run_analysis.R The script run_analysis.R has the following requirements to perform transformation on UCI HAR Dataset.
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set ,averages_data.txt with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The output file is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded to this repository.”
